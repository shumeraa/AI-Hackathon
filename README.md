BeHeal is the new AI-Powered platform built for volunteers to practice real-life conversations with natural disaster survivors. Engage with lifelike personas, receive feedback on how your words impact survivors' mental well-being, and build skills to provide comfort and understanding when itâ€™s needed most. Let's create a safer, more compassionate world together.

## Setting up Watsonx and the .env file
1. Log into Watsonx and create a new project
2. Create a new vector index and upload the PDF files from the AI-Hackathon\files directory
3. Once the vector index is created, save as it to a notebook as Deployable Flow
4. In the settings, create a new deployment space. Keep default settings.
5. Finish creating the notebook and go to the code instructions
6. Near the top, find the code that says space_id = <SPACE_ID>
7. Copy this ID and place it into the .env file where it is labeled
8. Next, find the line where it says: promoted_assets["vector_index_id"] = client.spaces.promote(VECTOR_INDEX_ID_1, VECTOR_INDEX_ID_2, SPACE_ID)
9. Copy each ID and paste it into the .env (SPACE_ID should already be filled out so you do not have to touch it).
10. For the project, copy its project ID and place it into PROJECT_KEY in the .env
11. In the Dashboard for Watsonx, create a new API key and place that into IBM_API_KEY spot in the .env
12. In an OpenAI account, create a new API key, add funds, and paste the key into OPENAI_API_KEY

## Start the backend
1. cd to server
2. In Anaconda where the environment.yaml file is, perform: conda create --name envname python=3.12.7
3. Then activate the environment by doing: conda activate envname
5. Run the backend by simply running the python file server.py

## Start the frontend
1. cd to ai-app
2. in your terminal write npm install
3. then write npm run start
4. the web app should now be running in your browser

## Things to remember:
- If there are any issues when running npm, perform npm audit fix --force to fix any dependency issues
